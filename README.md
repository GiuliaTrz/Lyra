# Lyra 🌙

Lyra is a webapp with a minimalist and calming UI that shows you the current phase of the moon in your area. Your location is detected using your IP address (it's not your exact position, but it's precise enough for its purpose).

> [!WARNING]  
> To use Lyra, you need an API account at [astronomyapi.com](https://astronomyapi.com).

> Once entered, the Application ID and Application Secret are saved in the browser local storage.
